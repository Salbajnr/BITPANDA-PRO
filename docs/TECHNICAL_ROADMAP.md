# 🔧 Technical Implementation Roadmap

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIXES (This Week)

### Day 1: Fix React Component Issues
**Problem**: Landing page crashing due to invalid component imports
**Files to fix**: `client/src/pages/Landing.tsx`

```typescript
// Current issue: Importing JSX elements instead of components
import { Coins, TrendingUp, ChartPie, Banknote, Gem, ChartColumn } from 'lucide-react';

// Fix: These should be imported as React components, not JSX
// Check if getCryptoLogo function is properly exporting components
```

1. Open Replit Database tool
2. Create new PostgreSQL database
