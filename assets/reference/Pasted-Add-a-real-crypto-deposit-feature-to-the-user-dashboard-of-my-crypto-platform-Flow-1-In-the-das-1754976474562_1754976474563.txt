Add a real crypto deposit feature to the user dashboard of my crypto platform.

Flow:
	1.	In the dashboard, users click a Deposit button.
	2.	They are routed to a “Select Payment Method” page showing multiple external crypto payment providers (e.g., Bybit, Binance, Crypto.com, OKX, KuCoin).
	3.	When a user selects a payment method, open the official deposit page of the selected provider in a new tab or embedded browser view.
	4.	once user selects payment method and crypto currency to make deposit to, an address will be popped out for the user to make payment to once user clicks address copied the address should auto add to users clipboard and navigate user to their selected  provider to make payment to (this part happens externally on the provider’s site).
	5.	After making the payment, the user returns to my platform and is prompted to upload proof of payment (screenshot, transaction hash, or receipt).
	6.	Store proof in the backend linked to the user’s deposit request with fields:
	•	userId
	•	paymentMethod
	•	depositAmount (user-entered)
	•	proofOfPayment (file upload or hash)
	•	status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
	•	createdAt
	7.	Admin panel must have a Deposit Management section where the admin can:
	•	View all pending deposits.
	•	Verify payment manually by checking the proof.
	•	Approve or reject the deposit.
	•	On approval, manually update the user’s wallet balance.
	•	On rejection, send a rejection reason to the user via notification.
	8.	Send notifications to the user:
	•	Deposit Pending when proof is submitted.
	•	Deposit Approved when admin confirms payment.
	•	Deposit Rejected with a reason if admin rejects.

Technical Requirements:
	•	Frontend: Show payment method cards with logos, upload proof UI, status tracking.
	•	Backend: REST API for deposit creation, file upload handling, and admin approval.
	•	Security:
	•	Validate file types for proof uploads (e.g., PNG, JPG, PDF).
	•	Role-based access control (users can only view their own deposits; admins can view all).
	•	Sanitize all inputs.
	•	Database: New deposits table/collection for tracking.

Goal: A realistic deposit flow that uses real payment provider websites for wallet addresses but requires admin confirmation before updating the user’s balance.
