# Overview

This is a cryptocurrency simulation platform called "BITPANDA PRO" designed to provide a realistic trading experience for users while maintaining complete admin control over simulated balances. The platform features two distinct user roles: Admin and Normal User, with separate authentication flows and role-based access controls. The system is built to look and behave like a live crypto trading platform while being completely simulated, ensuring users cannot distinguish between real and simulated environments.
